# SpaceInvaders
Currently a single level only, built for Python practice/learning.
## To do (or not):
- integrate existing player_exploding sprites
- replace a-z with sprites
- second alien type to move intermittently across the top of screen l to r and r to l
- sound effects
- level settings for easily setting up multiple levels
